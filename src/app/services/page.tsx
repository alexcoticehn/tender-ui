            <h2 className="text-2xl font-semibold mb-2">EMDR Therapy</h2>
            <p>Sometimes talk therapy isn&apos;t enough, especially when trauma lives in the body, not just the mind. EMDR (Eye Movement Desensitization and Reprocessing) helps you process painful experiences by engaging the brain&apos;s natural healing systems. Using gentle, structured techniques like eye movements or tapping, EMDR allows memories to be integrated in a way that feels safer and less overwhelming. It can be especially helpful if you&apos;ve felt stuck, even with insight or coping tools. We&apos;ll move at your pace, and I&apos;ll support you in feeling steady every step of the way.</p>
